#+TITLE: Personal configuration

* Vim

I use vim as a fast fallback for quick edits as my fingers are used to it. This is a minimal configuration for supporting cyrillic keyboard layout, tabs, syntax etc. I use this exact =.vimrc= since 2017 with no changes.

* Emacs

This is my fourth attempt at configuring the beast. Everything happens inside =k60= dir. Config is kinda modular and is split by topics. Packages are loaded with the =use-package= macro to maintain portability.

* SSH

Minimal configuration. Tells =sshd= to store keys in macOS Keychain and loads a private file with aliases and logins.

* Common Lisp

Basic SBCL config for loading [[Quicklisp][https://quicklisp.org/beta]] (you have to install it manually).

TODO: add Sly initialization to fix broken terminal I/O.
